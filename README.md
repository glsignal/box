# The Box

This is really the box of random but useful junk, that doesn't warrant its own repository or hosting infrastructure.

Think of it as the digital equivalent of that drawer in your home that has all of the junk you don't know what to do with - odd keys you've found, fresh but single AA batteries, loose button from someone's coat, half dried out permanent markers etc.
