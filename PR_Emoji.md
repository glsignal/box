# Code Review Emoji

This has been extremely useful in past teams, so I'm rebuilding an emoji list for PR review comments and an explanation associated with them here

In general, each review comment will fall under one (or more) of the following emoji designations

## Blocking

:exclamation: Blocking (change requested or at least discussion required)

## Non-blocking

:thought_balloon: Thinking out loud - this isn't necessarily actionable, but indicates if the reviewer is unsure about a change or has some concerns that aren't blocking, they can appear here

:bulb: Idea or suggestion - usually offering another way of solving the same problem with some additional benefit for e.g. readability, allocations, performance etc.​

:pencil2: Small correction - usually a typo, translation change, or something of that nature
